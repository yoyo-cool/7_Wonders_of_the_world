        <p><span>Petra,</span> originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or RaqÄ“mo , is a historic and archaeological 
        city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system,
        Petra is also called the <span>"Rose City"</span> because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is
        carved; <span>it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a poem of 1845 by
        John Burgon</span>. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by
        mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the
        Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through a famously picturesque <span>1.2-kilometre-long</span>
        gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.</p>
