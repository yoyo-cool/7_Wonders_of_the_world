        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in <span>Agra,
        Uttar Pradesh.</span> It was commissioned in <span>1631</span> by the <span>fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan</span> 
        to house the tomb of his beloved wife, <span>Mumtaz Mahal;</span> it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
        The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
        house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. The construction
        of the mausoleum was essentially completed in <span>1643,</span> but work continued on other phases of the
        project for another 10 years.</p>
