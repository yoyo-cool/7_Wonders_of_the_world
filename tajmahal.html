        <p>The Taj Maha is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra
        , Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan 
         to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
          The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
           house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. The Taj Mahal
            was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
            who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.</p>
