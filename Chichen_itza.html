        <p><span>Chichén Itzá</span> was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic
            period. The archeological site is located in <span>Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.</span>
            Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern <span>Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic</span>
            through the Terminal Classic and into the early portion of the Postclassic period. The site
            exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico
            and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of <span>central
            Mexican styles</span> was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even 
            conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of
            these <span>non-Maya styles</span> more as the result of cultural diffusion. </p>
