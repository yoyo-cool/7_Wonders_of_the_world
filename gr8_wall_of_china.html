        <p><span>The Great Wall of China</span> is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
        northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as <span>protection against various
        nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.</span> Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall
        have included <span></span>border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along 
        the Silk Road,</span> regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and
        emigration. It is as long as <span>21,196 km</span> in length. Furthermore, the defensive
        characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of <span>watchtowers, 
        troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities</span> through the means of smoke or fire,
        and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.</p><br>
