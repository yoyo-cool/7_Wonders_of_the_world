        <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
         northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
          nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall
           have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along 
           the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and
            emigration.   Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced 
            by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities 
            through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served 
            as a transportation corridor.</p><br>
